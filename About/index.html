                    <li>I was able to crack all the accounts of my classmates who were using the default password (wich was using a predictable pattern) of the virtual classroom.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I tried to do a blind JSON injection on Google Colab by modifying the API responses coming from the jupyter notebook inside the Colab's VM (but It ended up being a waste of time (-.-) ).</li>

                </ul>
